My C Project Template
---------------------

Change the content of file "Makefile", replace XYZ by the name of your library. Put standalone programs (c file containing main()) into bin directory. Put your tests into a .c file into tests directory. See bstr_tests.c for an example test program. Based on "Learn C the hard way" project structure.
